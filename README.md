Implementation of the `miniml` animal in Andrej Bauer's [Programming Language Zoo](http://andrej.com/plzoo/).

> A simple eager purely functional language with integers and booleans as base types. Functions can be recursive so the language is Turing complete. Programs are compiled and executed by an abstract machine, akin to Landin's [SECD machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine).
